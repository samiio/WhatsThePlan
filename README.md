# WhatsThePlan
Android app implemented using the MVVM design pattern.
This app helps users choose a place to go, or a place to eat. 


# How it works:

Add your options to the "Plans" or "Restaurants" tab.

Go to the "Play" tab and click the "Find Plan" or "Find Restaurant" buttons.

The app will randomly pick a place for you to go or eat.
